Create a website about a (school-appropriate) topic that interests you.
This might be an extracurricular activitiy in which you participate, a sport or instrument you play, or just a hobby of yours.
For now, your website should be informative in nature.
Later, we'll add some style and creative expression.

More specifically, your website must include and incorporate the following features and elements.

4 distinct pages (i.e., .html files)
1 page that gives a brief overview of your website topic (i.e., a homepage, which should be written in your index.html file)
3 pages that discuss separate subtopics in greater detail
A navigation bar that allows you to navigate to and from each of the 4 pages
A unique and descriptive <title> for each of the 4 pages
At least 3 of the header tags variations: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>
At least 7 hyperlinks
At least 4 internal links that use a relative URL: <a href="/relative/url.html> or <a href="#id">
At least 3 external links that use an absolute URL: <a href="https://absoluteurl.com">
At least 1 image per page: <img src="/images/picture.png">
All images must be stored in a folder named images (the use of subfolders within images is at your discretion)
At least 2 lists
At least 1 ordered list: <ol>
At least 1 unordered list: <ul>
At least 1 horizontal rule: <hr/>
At least 1 <table>
Your <table> must include a header (<thead>), a body (<tbody>), and a footer (<tfoot>)
A consistent page footer on every page
Your footer must include the copyright symbol and year (i.e., © 2018)
Your footer must include the school (appropriately hyperlinked), and course (i.e., AIT | APSCS)
Your footer must include a contact email (appropriately hyperlinked)
You must not use an actual email (instead, use info@example.com)
To avoid confusion, your directory structure must match the following.
If something is followed with a /, it is a folder; otherwise, it is a file.

problem-set-3/
   images/
      myimage1.png
      subfolder/
         myimage2.png
   index.html
   mysubtopic1.html
   mysubtopic2.html
   mysubtopic3.html
   README.md
Of course, your filenames will be different than mine.
They are alphabetized, so they will likely appear in a different order, too.
The subfolder inside of the images folder is optional.
You might find it useful to further categorize your pictures, but it is not required.
The image files inside of the images and subfolder folders are examples.
Yours, of course, will be named differently.

CSS Requirements
Modify the website you created for Problem Set 3, and create a new and improved website for Problem Set 3½.
You'll be adding CSS to make it look a whole lot cooler.
You're free to exercise creative expression and design, but must meet the minimum specifications below.

More specifically, your website must include and incorporate the following features and elements.

At least 1 externally linked CSS file, which contains the vast majority of your styles.
Your CSS file(s) should be in a folder named styles.
At least 3 inline styles per page (for one-off styles that typically aren't replicated elsewhere).
At least 3 different type selectors.
At least 3 different class selectors.
At least 3 different ID selectors.
At least 3 different attribute selectors.
At least 1 universal selector.
At least 3 different combinators.
At least 3 different pseudo-classes.
A background-color for each page.
If you wish, you may incorporate multiple background-colors on a single page.
A font, font-size, font-style, font-weight, color, and text-decoration for at least 1 (though not necessarily the same) text element per page.
A :hover effect for each link.
Appropriate element spacing using margin and/or padding (this is understandably subjective).
A border around at least 1 image per page.
At least 1 of your borders must incorporate rounded corners.
All img dimensions must be defined in the externally linked CSS page, and not as a tag attribute.
To avoid confusion, your directory structure must match the following.
If something is followed with a /, it is a folder; otherwise, it is a file.

problem-set-3/
   images/
      kitchen.png
      meals/
         pasta.png
   index.html
   recipes.html
   ingredients.html
   suppliers.html
   README.md
   styles/
      yourfile.css
Of course, your filenames will be different than mine.
They are alphabetized, so they will likely appear in a different order, too.
The meals/ subfolder inside of the images/ folder is optional.
You might find it useful to further categorize your pictures, but it is not required.
The image files inside of the images/ and meals/ folders are examples.
Yours, of course, will be named differently.
